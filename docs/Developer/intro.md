## Getting Started

Get started by **cloning my repository [0rbitSoc/aura](https://github.com/0rbitSoc/aura)**, or run the command;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0rbitSoc/aura.git
```

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [npm] version 6.0 or above.

## Install Dependencies

- Go to the directory where you cloned the repository and run,

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all the packages required to run this project!
**After installing run the development server and start editing the project **

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.
Visit **localhost:3000** to view the website running.

## Start your site

After development you can run these commands to build the optimised app!

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```


The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Then you can deploy it to any of these platforms.
