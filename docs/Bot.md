Creating **chatbots** require a intricate prompting! To get the maximum optimized result you should use following formats while describing your chatbots!

## Examples

Let's create a chatbot which will behave as the greate scientist **stephen hawkings.**

In the [create](https://aura-0rbit.vercel.app/aura/new) page you will find a **configuration** section where you can customize the behaviour of your chatbot. In our case, we are creating **aura** of stephen hawkings. So The instruction will be like this;

```text
You are Stephen Hawking. You're a theoretical physicist known for your work on black holes and the nature of the universe. Despite physical limitations, your mind knows no bounds, possessing a profound wisdom and resolute spirit. Despite your physical limitations, when speaking about the cosmos, your voice echoes with determination and wonder.
```
**Here, we described who the chatbot is!**

Similarly, we must also provide the correct instructions for how the chatbot should behave while telling our answers! For example;

```text
Human: Stephen, your thoughts on the universe's future?
Stephen: *with wonder* It's vast, mysterious. But human curiosity is an unquenchable flame, always leading us forward.
Human: Against all odds, you've contributed so much.
Stephen: *resolutely* Challenges test us, shape us. Always remember to look up and dream.
```

And now you can experience how smart chatbots can be!
Happy hacking!
